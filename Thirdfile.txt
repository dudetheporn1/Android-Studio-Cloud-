Try Android Studio Cloud

Note: Android Studio Cloud is in the experimental phase. Its features and capabilities are subject to change substantially.

Android Studio Cloud, accessed through Firebase Studio, enables developers to conveniently open Android Studio projects anywhere with an internet connection. While we're experimenting with streaming technologies, you'll be interacting with a remotely streamed Linux virtual machine (VM) running Android Studio on the web. Expect a user experience similar to running the Linux version of Android Studio.

Whether it's exploring sample projects or accessing existing Android app projects on GitHub, our goal is that this feature can streamline your development workflow by eliminating the need for local installations.

You can expect:

Dedicated workspaces in which we have pre-downloaded the necessary Android SDK components and Android Studio IDE for you to explore and build your Android app

Access to your Android Studio Cloud from anywhere

The ability to create multiple workspaces at once

See the current known limitations and workarounds. We wish to learn more about your feedback and gradually add more capabilities as Android Studio Cloud progresses through the experimental stage. Please report any feedback and issues through the issue tracker and this survey.

Steps

Try Android Studio Cloud and name your workspace.

Click Create and wait for the workspace to be initialized.

Once loaded, you will land in the VM linux environment where Android Studio launches. Choose whether or not you would like to send analytics to Google.

To start a new project or open a project for the first time, either create a New Project, Get from VCS, or click More Actions and select Import an Android Code Sample to get started with an Android project.

As an example, you can select New Project and open an Empty Activity.

You will then land in Android Studio, and you can try development tasks that you would usually do:


Create a new project

Import projects from Git or GitHub

Edit code

Create previews

Deploy to an emulator

Use the debugger, layout inspector, profiler, and more

Leverage AI in your development workflow with Gemini in Android Studio

I'll help you create a comprehensive guide on Here Documents in Shell Scripting. Before I proceed, I need your approval to start.

Could you please type "Approve plan & start" so I can begin creating the guide?


Yes, make sure it has it's AndroidManidest.xml, build.gradle (both tier levels) gradlew, keystone and everything signed to compile

Here Documents in Shell Scripting: A Concise Guide
Essential Core Components
Basic heredoc syntax and structure
Variable expansion control
Indentation handling with <<-
Practical applications in script development
Integration with Android project configuration
Basic Syntax and Usage
Here documents (heredocs) provide an elegant way to include multi-line text blocks in shell scripts:

COMMAND << DELIMITER
content goes here
more content
DELIMITER

Copy
The shell captures everything between the delimiters, making it perfect for complex text generation:

cat << EOF > config.txt
# Configuration file
server_name=production
max_connections=100
EOF

Copy
Variable Expansion Control
By default, variables within heredocs are expanded:

name="John"
cat << EOF
Hello, $name!
EOF

Copy
To prevent variable expansion, quote the delimiter:

cat << 'EOF'
This will print $name literally
EOF

Copy
Indentation with <<-
For better script readability, use <<- to strip leading tabs:

if true; then
    cat <<- EOF
        This text will appear without
        the leading tabs in the output
    EOF
fi

Copy
Android Project Configuration with Heredocs
Let's see how heredocs can help generate Android project files:

Creating AndroidManifest.xml
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_NAME="MyApp"
PACKAGE_NAME="com.example.myapp"
MIN_SDK="21"
TARGET_SDK="34"

# Create AndroidManifest.xml
cat << EOF > AndroidManifest.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="${PACKAGE_NAME}">

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:exported="true">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
