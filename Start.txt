Integration with Android project configuration
Basic Syntax and Usage
Here documents (heredocs) provide an elegant way to include multi-line text blocks in shell scripts:

COMMAND << DELIMITER
content goes here
more content
DELIMITER

Copy
The shell captures everything between the delimiters, making it perfect for complex text generation:

cat << EOF > config.txt
# Configuration file
server_name=production
max_connections=100
EOF

Copy
Variable Expansion Control
By default, variables within heredocs are expanded:

name="John"
cat << EOF
Hello, $name!
EOF

Copy
To prevent variable expansion, quote the delimiter:

cat << 'EOF'
This will print $name literally
EOF

Copy
Indentation with <<-
For better script readability, use <<- to strip leading tabs:

if true; then
    cat <<- EOF
        This text will appear without
        the leading tabs in the output
    EOF
fi

Android Project Configuration with Heredocs
Let's see how heredocs can help generate Android project files:
